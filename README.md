# Turing test EXtended Architecture (TEXA): A method for interacting, evaluating and assessing AI

TEXA is a novel framework backed by a mathematical oriented theory(Texa Theory, refer to /texa-docs) for interacting, evaluating and assessing AIs.


# LIBRARIES USED:

The system uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [texalib] - Special Math library written from scratch for TEXA
* [texajson] - Dedicated JSON interpreter library that serves as interface to  native Datastore.
* [JS] - evented I/O for the backend
* [jQuery] - duh
* [ElizaBOT-JS] - Javascript implementation of the ELIZA specification by Weizenbaum, 1966. Special thanks to Landsteiner!


# Installation:

TEXA requires [Go Lang](https://golang.org/)  v1.7+ to run.

Install the dependencies, devDependencies and start the server.

``$ go version``

``$ export GOPATH=texa_workspace_path`` set GOPATH environment variable

``$ cd $GOPATH/src/``

``$ export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin``

``$ go get -u github.com/kardianos/govendor``

``$ export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH``

``$ git clone https://github.com/SagarPuneria/texa.git``

``$ govendor sync``

``$ cd $GOPATH/src/texa/``

``$ go build main.go``

``$ ./main "mongodbUserName" "mongodbPassword" "mongodbIP" "mongodbPort"`` if user name and password is not configured in mongodb environment then give empty string.


### TODO (Future Work)

 - Stability offered only for Unit Test Instance. Can support multiple cases without SLA.
- Lacks complete support for non-Eliza AIs(non-JS REF).
- APIs can be exposed to build use-cases such as ranking apps etc.
 - Feel free to try new ideas!
